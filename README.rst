How to use
==========

After adding a Booking, non managers users see that the slot is busy, managers 
see in the slot who made the request, a link to the Booking detail and a link to 
move the Booking.

Managers can confirm a Booking using workflow transitions. 
The workflow transition triggers an email to be sent to the booker (see below).

Content Rules (mail notifications)
==================================

There are additional content rules that can be used to notify booking owner when his booking has been accepted
or re-scheduled.

Rules are automatically created and enabled. See the Rule control panel to change settings.

There's also a rule that can warn the Booking Folder responsible when new booking are created, but you need to
manually enable it on folders. 

Installation
